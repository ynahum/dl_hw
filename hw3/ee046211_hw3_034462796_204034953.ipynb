    "* You are consulting for a healthcare company. They provide you with clinical notes of the first encounter that each patient had with their doctor regarding a particular medical episode.\n",
    "* There are a total of 12 million patients and clinical notes. At the time that each clinical note was written, the underlying illnesses associated with the medical episode were unknown to the doctor. \n",
    "* The company provides you with the true set of illnesses associated with each medical episode and asks you to build a model that can infer these underlying illnesses using only the current clinical note and all previous clinical notes belonging to the patient.\n",
    "* The set of notes provided to you span 10 years; each patient therefore can have multiple clinical notes (medical episodes) in that period.\n",
    "* You also have a vector representation of each patient note (note-vector) which was built using a summation of the word vectors of the note.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You assume that a patient’s past medical history is informative of their current illness. As such, you apply a recurrent neural network to predict the current illness based on the patient’s current and previous note-vectors. Explain why a recurrent neural network would yield better results than a feed-forward network in which your input is the summation of past and current note-vectors?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A patient may have any number of illnesses from a list of 70,000 known medical illnesses. The output of your recurrent neural network will therefore be a vector with 70,000 elements. Each element in this output vector represents the probability that the patient has the illness that maps to that particular element. Illnesses are not mutually exclusive i.e. having one illness does not preclude you from having any other illnesses. Given this insight, is it better to have a sigmoid non-linearity or a softmax non-linearity as your output unit? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You try to figure out a better way to reduce the training and testing time of your model. You perform a run time analysis and observe that the computational bottleneck is in your output unit: the number of target illnesses is too high. Each illness in the list of 70,000 illnesses belongs to one of 300 classes (e.g. a migraine belongs to the neurological disorder class). He shares with you a dictionary which maps each illness to its corresponding class. How can you use this information to reduce the **time** complexity of your model?"
