    "You have to design an MLP with the following input: DNA sequences of length $d$. The DNA is a sequence of bases, where each base can be one of 4 options: $(C, T, G, A)$. Thus, the input can be described as the following matrix: $$ X \\in \\mathcal{R}^{4 \\times d}, $$ where $X[j,i]$ denotes the measured value of base concentration of the $j^{th}$ base at location $i$. \n",

    "1. The LeakyReLU activation is rescale symmetric, so there is rescale invariance between $z_1=W_1X$ and $\\phi(z_1)$. Meaning, $\\forall c >0$ if we multiply $W_1$ by $c$ and multiply  $W_2$ by $\\frac{1}{c}$ we get the same function.  \n",

    "2. We can demonstrate that at a given layer, the matrix product of inputs $x$ and weight matrix $a$ that is initialized from a standard normal distribution will, on average, have a standard deviation very close to the square root of the number of input connections. For our example, with 512 dimensions, show that for 10,000 multiplications of $a$ and $x$, the empirical standard deviation is similar to the square root of the number of input connections. Use the unbiased version: $$ \\hat{std} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{10000}\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N y^2}{10000}}, $$ where $y=ax$ and $N$ is the number of input connections. **Print** the mean, std and the square root of the number of input connections.\n",
    "3. For the code from 1, normalize the weight initialization by the square root of the input connections. How does that change the outcome? **Print** the mean and std after the modification.\n",
    "4. Add a `tanh()` activation after each layer for the code from 1. **Print** the mean and std after the modification. Explain the result.\n",
    "5. Xavier initialization sets a layer’s weights to values chosen from a random uniform distribution that’s bounded between $$\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{6}{n_i + n_{i+1}}}$$ where $n_i$ is the number of incoming network connections, or “fan-in,” to the layer, and $ n_{i+1}$ is the number of outgoing network connections from that layer, also known as the “fan-out”. Glorot and Bengio believed that Xavier weight initialization would maintain the variance of activations and back-propagated gradients all the way up or down the layers of a network and demonstrated that networks initialized with Xavier achieved substantially quicker convergence and higher accuracy. Implement **Xavier Uniform** as `xavier_init(fan_in, fan_out)`, a function that returns a tensor initialized according to **Xavier Uniform**. Use it on the simple network from 1 with `tanh` activation. **Print** the mean and std after the modification.\n",
    "6. If you try to replace the `tanh` activation with `relu` activation in section 5, you will see very different results. Xavier strives to acheive activation outputs of each layer to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation around 1, on average. When using a ReLU activation, a single layer will, on average have standard deviation that’s very close to the square root of the number of input connections, **divided by the square root of two** ($\\sqrt{\\frac{512}{2}}$ in our example). **Kaiming He et. al.** proposed an initialization scheme that’s tailored for deep neural nets that use these kinds of asymmetric, non-linear activations. Implement **Kaiming Normal** as `kaiming_init(fan_in, fan_out)`, a function that returns a tensor initialized according to **Kaiming Normal** (use `fan_in` mode). Use it on the simple network from 1 with `relu` activation. **Print** the mean and std after the modification. What happens when you use Xavier with RelU activation?"
